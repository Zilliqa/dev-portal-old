## How to Resync Node

The node might go out of sync if it fails to receive new blocks from the network. In this case, the node would ideally automatically sync without any manual intervention.

However, if the node is unable to resync on its own, it will need to be launched again in a fresh mode (i.e. clean start). Please refer to the section [Preparing the node](staking-ssn-setup#preparing-the-node) at Getting started page
