## Introduction

While it's possible to use the public endpoint provided by Zilliqa to interact
with the blockchain, we recommend that all exchanges that wish to support
trading on the mainnet set up seed nodes. This section walks you through the
basic steps needed to get the seed node up and running.

## Modes

Running a seed node is possible through 3 different modes. Exchanges can use
whichever mode is feasible for their case.

- IP whitelisting
- Key whitelisting (with and without open inbound port)

### IP Whitelisting Mode

In IP whitelisting mode, blockchain data is pushed directly to exchanges in
periodic intervals. As seed nodes using this mode receive data directly and do
not otherwise pull data from peers, exchanges must be whitelisted by Zilliqa to
receive these data broadcasts. This requires a static, public IP address with
minimally two open ports (inbound and outbound) at which it can be reached.
The [IP Whitelisting](exchange-ip-whitelisting) section contains information
about running a node in IP whitelisting mode.

### Key Whitelisting Mode

In key whitelisting mode, blockchain data is pulled by the seed from Zilliqa
Research-hosted public seed nodes in periodic intervals. Exchanges using
this mode generate a public-private key pair and share their public key with
Zilliqa Research for whitelisting. At minimum, a port has to be opened for
outbound traffic. Exchanges using this mode have the further option of
configuring a second port for inbound traffic. The [Key Whitelisting](exchange-key-whitelisting-1)
section contains information about running a node in key whitelisting mode.

## Minimum Hardware Requirements

- x64 Linux operating system (e.g Ubuntu 18.04.5)
- Recent dual core processor @ 2.2 GHZ. Examples: Intel Xeon (Skylake)
- 8GB DRR3 RAM or higher
- Public static IP address
- 500GB Solid State Drive
- 100MB/s upload and download bandwidth
