RentOnZilliqa, the Zilliqa Fullstack app, is a full-fledged application on the Zilliqa Blockchain for listing and renting houses. In this guide, we will go through the process of building the full-stack application, from writing the contract to building the frontend application.

## Brief details of the application

A user can create an account as a renter or a host.

If the user is a host, they can create a listing of a home with details of the home (e.g., title, address, amenities) and rental price per night. They can also see the list of all homes as well as the homes they hosted. They can edit the details of a home and delete it from the listing as well.

If the user is a renter, they can rent a home from the list given that it is not unavailable. A home is unavailable if it is rented and the rent duration has not passed yet. Once the user rents the home by paying the amount in ZIL, we mark the home as unavailable. The amount is stored in the contract.

A host can also see the rent accumulated in their account. They can claim the rent anytime they want.
