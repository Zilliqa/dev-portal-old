![Viewblock](../../assets/application/tools/viewblock.png)

Viewblock explorer allows you to look at the status of your transaction, current status of the Zilliqa network, contract source code etc. 

| Network | Link |
| ------- | ---- |
| Mainnet | https://viewblock.io/zilliqa |
| Testnet | https://viewblock.io/zilliqa?network=testnet |

For example, this is the viewblock [transaction link](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/tx/c4030c73d6dae558ff0c9d98237101e342888115f13219a00bb14a8ee46fa3be?network=testnet) for a getHello() transition transaction.
Viewblock supports both Zilliqa testnet and mainnet.

[Viewblock API](https://viewblock.io/api) - Viewblock's API is a valuable resource for some additional methods that a developer might require for his application, for example : retrieving all transactions sent by an address.

[Viewblock Zilliqa Stats](https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/stats) - Viewblock's statistics provide statistical information about Zilliqa network such as difficulty over time, number of blocks over time and address growth over time.
