title: Using Mining Pools
---
The Zilliqa blockchain uses Ethereum's Ethash proof-of-work algorithm. This allows existing mining pool operations to easily integrate mining on Zilliqa, giving retail miners another way to participate in the Zilliqa Mainnet.

## Getting Started

The Zilliqa page on [MiningPoolStats](https://miningpoolstats.stream/zilliqa) has a list of mining pools that support Zilliqa. Please refer to the pool's website for specific instructions on how to participate.
