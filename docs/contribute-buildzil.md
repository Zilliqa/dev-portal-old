title: Building Zilliqa
---
The Zilliqa core is implemented in C++ and archived in our open-source [Github repository](https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa/).

Zilliqa Research primarily maintains the code base and moderates contributions from external developers.

While we have made great strides to realize the core protocol that runs the Zilliqa Mainnet, this continues to be a living, breathing endeavour. New features, improvements, and bug fixes are regularly pushed. Contributions from the developer community towards the advancement of this project are always welcome.

## Supported platforms

The Zilliqa client is officially supported only on Ubuntu 16.04.

To support developers on other operating systems, we also maintain a Docker image.
