title: Building Zilliqa
---
The Zilliqa core is implemented in C++ and maintained in our open-source [Github repository](https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa/).

Zilliqa Research primarily maintains the code base and moderates contributions from external developers.

While we have made great strides to realize the core protocol that runs the Zilliqa Mainnet, this continues to be a living, breathing endeavour. New features, improvements, and bug fixes are regularly pushed. Contributions from the developer community towards the advancement of this project are always welcome.
