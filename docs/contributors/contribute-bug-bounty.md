Developers can also contribute to the advancement of Zilliqa by reporting security bugs and vulnerabilities in our bug bounty program.

We reward contributions with payouts of up to $10,000 depending on the nature of the reported vulnerability. We have recently switched to a new bug bounty platform, HackerOne. We will be making the program public soon in 2021.

If you need to report any vulnerability, please reach out to security[at]zilliqa.com and we will get you onboard to the private bounty program.
