A Consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies.

## Types of Consensus Mechanism

### PoW: Proof of Work
Proof of work describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to deter dos(denial-of-service) attacks and other malicious attacks. It requires to solve a computational challenging puzzle in order to create new blocks in Blockchain.

### PoS: Proof of Stake
Proof-of-Stake mechanism achieve consensus by requiring users to stake an amount of their tokens so as to have a chance of being selected to validate blocks of transactions, and get rewarded for doing so. Priority is given to miners who have purchased the most stake in the blockchain system.

### DPoS: Delegated Proof of Stake
This form of consensus mirrors the election of members in governing bodies. Witnesses, those who validate transactions, are elected.
