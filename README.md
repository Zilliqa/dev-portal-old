This repository holds the source files for Zilliqa's developer portal website.

### Installation

```
$ yarn

```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Local Deployment via Docker container

To build the docker container

```
./build_container.sh
```

To run the container

```
./run_container.sh
```

You can then access the site via

```
http://localhost:8080
```

To stop and remove the container

```
./stop_container.sh
```

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

cd docs
find */*.md -exec npx markdown-link-check {} \;
```
